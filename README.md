# Project-1-
The aim of our project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the Olympics dataset to gain valuable insights into the history and trends of the Olympic Games. We are particularly interested in exploring the relationship between an athlete's attributes and their performance in the Olympics.

We will be using the Olympics dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes information such as athlete details (ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight), team information (Team, NOC), Games details (Year, Season, City), sports information (Sport, Event), and medal achievements (Medal type). 

In the question “How has the average age of Olympic athletes changed over the years?” The csv file was first organized into a main data frame using pandas, from there the data was sorted by gender by grouping the data frame by “sex” and “age”. Once the data was divided by gender, separate data frames were created for each gender. Once the data was separated into gender data frames, matplotlib was used to create graphs that show the average age of gender per year. Then to find the oldest and youngest participants of each gender the max and min functions were used as well as sorting the data frame by ascending and descending order.
