# Project-1-
The aim of our project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the Olympics dataset to gain valuable insights into the history and trends of the Olympic Games. We are particularly interested in exploring the relationship between an athlete's attributes and their performance in the Olympics.

We will be using the Olympics dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes information such as athlete details (ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight), team information (Team, NOC), Games details (Year, Season, City), sports information (Sport, Event), and medal achievements (Medal type).
